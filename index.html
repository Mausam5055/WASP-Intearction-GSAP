                <div class="title">3d animation design for website</div>
                <p>I created a fully responsive 3D animated website that combines creativity with interactivity using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), one of the most powerful JavaScript libraries for high-performance animations. The website seamlessly integrates 3D motion effects, smooth scroll transitions, and interactive UI elements to offer an immersive user experience. Leveraging GSAP’s advanced timeline and easing functionalities, I crafted animations that feel fluid and natural, enhancing both visual appeal and usability. The tech stack includes GSAP for scroll-triggered and custom animations, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for structure and styling, and optionally Three.js for adding 3D model depth. It is designed with responsive principles to ensure smooth performance across all devices. Key features include an animated landing section with text and image transitions, scroll-based 3D interactions, layered motion design with parallax and perspective, custom cursor effects, and seamless section transitions for a cinematic storytelling experience. This project not only enhanced my animation and design skills but also deepened my understanding of how micro-interactions and motion design can elevate a website’s overall UX. My goal was to build a visually stunning, intuitive experience that shows how modern web design can be both functional and expressive — ideal for portfolios, creative agencies, or cutting-edge digital brands.</p>

                <p>Hey there! I'm Mausam Kar, a passionate and curious tech enthusiast from Assam, India. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML at VIT Bhopal University. With a strong foundation in programming and a creative spark, I strive to build innovative solutions that blend technology with real-world impact.

                    I specialize in front-end development, and I’m constantly exploring new tools and frameworks like ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to craft responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly interfaces. I’ve also worked with Python, Flask, Django, Bootstrap, and I'm diving into the world of DevOps, cloud computing, and backend integration to become a full-stack powerhouse.
                    
                    Apart from coding, I enjoy painting, playing games, and spending time with pets—these hobbies fuel my creativity and help me stay grounded. I'm always up for a challenge, whether it's a coding competition, a collaborative project, or learning a new technology.</p>
